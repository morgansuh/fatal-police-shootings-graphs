# fatal-police-shootings-graphs
Two graphs based on The Washington Post Fatal Police Shootings Data:
The first graph shows total shootings by race (Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American, White) per 100k population each year and the second graph is a stacked area chart showing the percentages of unarmed/armed shootings. 
These graphs were used to create a policy brief on how to decrease fatal shootings by police (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBRK-qxe5X7Cz7yuVEJgs_30gk4bmSx2p0DTylhaF2s/edit?usp=sharing).
